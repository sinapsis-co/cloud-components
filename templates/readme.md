This folder includes some frontend templates.

Depending on the template you want to run you should go to /templates/frontend and rename it to "webapp" and remove the rest of folders in that location.

There are some scripts you should run depending on the project you want to run.

In the /templates directory you can run the project you want using the following scripts

- If you are using vite-based template you should use "yarn start-spa dev webapp-vite", 
- if you are using pure react and webpack-based template you should use "yarn start-spa dev webapp"
