# Introducing Sinapsis Cloud Components

Our software engineering landscape thrives on the CC Framework—a culmination of precision, innovation, and reliability. This framework harnesses the power of [`CC-CORE`](./core/readme.md) and [`CC-SDK`](./sdk/readme.md), laying the groundwork for a production-ready serverless solution.

### CC-CORE: A Foundation Built on Precision

At the heart of our framework lies `CC-CORE`, a structured and opinionated cornerstone utilizing CDK to shape the entire application infrastructure. Within `CC-CORE`, Prefabs are meticulously crafted to embody production-ready capabilities, meeting stringent standards of quality, performance, and security.

### CC-SDK: Empowering Runtime Dynamics

Expanding the capabilities of `CC-CORE`, `CC-SDK` introduces essential runtime code, enabling typed lambda integrations within a broader infrastructure. This extension optimizes workflows, facilitating the creation of diverse serverless applications.

### Unified Strength: The CC Framework Advantage

Together, `CC-CORE` and `CC-SDK` form the CC Framework—an amalgamation that efficiently manages modern serverless architectures. This unified solution sets a high bar for software engineering, paving the way for reliable and innovative software ecosystems.

The CC Framework isn't just about technologies; it's about our commitment to engineering excellence. It represents a future where resilience, innovation, and meticulous engineering drive software development towards unprecedented reliability.
